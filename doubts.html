            The <span
                style="color:red; font-size:24px; font-weight: bold; background-color: aqua;">University
                of Michigan</span>
            opened its
            new Computer Center in 1971,
            in a brand-new building on Beal Avenue in Ann Arbor, with
            beige-brick exterior walls and a dark-glass front. The university's
            enormous mainframe computers stood in the middle of a vast white
            room, looking, as one faculty member remembers, "like one of the
            last scenes in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. Off to the side were
            dozens of keypunch machinesâ€”what passed in those days for computer
            terminals. In 1971, this was state of the art.
